# Multiple Linear Regression & Binomial Logistic Regression

## Multiple Linear Regression Project

In this project, I delved into the world of Multiple Linear Regression modeling for automidata dataset. 

### Project Highlights

- **Project Purpose**: This project demonstrates my knowledge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Multiple Linear Regression modeling.
- **Objective**: To build a robust Multiple Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions**: Explored data characteristics and validated assumptions.
  - **Part 2: Model Building and Evaluation**: Constructed, fine-tuned, and assessed the Multiple Linear Regression model.
  - **Part 3: Interpreting Model Results**: Extracted insights and provided data-driven business recommendations.

## Binomial Logistic Regression Project

In my Binomial Logistic Regression project for Waze dataset, I focused on estimating probabilities of outcomes using logistic regression. 

### Project Highlights

- **Project Purpose**: This project showcases my knowledge of EDA and Binomial Logistic Regression modeling.
- **Objective**: To construct a Binomial Logistic Regression model and evaluate its predictive capabilities.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions**: Utilized EDA techniques to understand data characteristics and validate assumptions.
  - **Part 2: Model Building and Evaluation**: Built, fine-tuned, and assessed the Binomial Logistic Regression model.
  - **Part 3: Interpreting Model Results**: Extracted crucial insights and provided data-driven business recommendations.
